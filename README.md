🚀 Java Data Structures & Algorithms
Welcome to my journey of learning and mastering Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using Java! This repository is a collection of my solutions to various DSA problems, organized by topic for easy reference.

🌟 About This Repository
The main goal of this project is to build a strong foundation in DSA, which is essential for problem-solving and writing efficient code. Here you will find:

Implementation of core data structures from scratch.

Solutions to classic algorithmic problems (e.g., searching, sorting, graph traversal).

Code written in Java, following best practices and including detailed comments.

I'll be consistently updating this repository as I solve more problems. Feel free to explore and learn along with me!

📂 Repository Structure
The code is organized into folders based on the data structure or algorithm. Each folder contains the Java source files for a specific topic.

✨ Topics Covered
I plan to cover the following topics, and more will be added over time:

Arrays: Basic operations, 2D arrays, dynamic arrays.

Strings: String manipulation, searching.

Linked Lists: Singly, Doubly, and Circular Linked Lists.

Stacks & Queues: Implementations and applications.

Hash Maps & Hash Sets: Understanding hashing and collision resolution.

Trees: Binary Trees, BSTs, AVL Trees, Heaps.

Graphs: Representation, BFS, DFS, Dijkstra's Algorithm.

Sorting Algorithms: Bubble, Insertion, Merge, Quick Sort.

Searching Algorithms: Linear, Binary Search.

Recursion & Dynamic Programming

🛠️ How to Use
To run any of the code, you'll need a Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine.
